BBCEarthDailyBot is a Telegram bot that posts a daily video to the [BBCEarthDaily](https://t.me/BBCEarthDaily) channel on Telegram. The videos are sourced from the [BBC Earth YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BBCEarth).

It uses AWS Lambda to execute the functions and AWS CloudWatch Events for scheduling the events.
